<h1 align = "center"> SOLID Principles </h1><br>
SOLID is an acronym that stands for five design principles that help software developers create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software. These principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) in the early 2000s, and have become widely adopted in the software development industry.

Here's what each letter in SOLID stands for:

### ⭐S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - 
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job to do. This helps to keep the code clean, concise, and easy to modify.  

### ⭐O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - 
This principle states that a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code.  

### ⭐L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - 
This principle states that any object of a superclass should be able to be replaced with an object of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This helps to ensure that inheritance relationships between classes are properly defined.  

### ⭐I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - 
This principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. In other words, you should create small, cohesive interfaces that are tailored to specific client needs, rather than creating large, monolithic interfaces.  

### ⭐D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - 
This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. This helps to decouple the code and make it more flexible and easier to change.
